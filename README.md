# Memory-manager-Linked-lists
Memory manager simulator in CPP using linked lists

This assignment is about simulating a memory manager in C++. The idea is to have 2 linked lists in parallel and allocate and free memory without running into errors. The 
requirements of the assignment can be found in the PDF file in this folder. You can run this program in your linux console and use the menu to allocate and free memory 
as you wish.
